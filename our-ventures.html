<p>The Entrewebneur Digital Identity is a project for a business network aimed at Web entrepreneurs.<br><br>

The Internet society has developed a global culture with a specific language: Internet English (IE). IE has an exceptionally fast rate of word creation. An example of this is the use of the affix -preneur in compounds such as Womenpreneur, Homepreneur, Mompreneur, Blackpreneur or Youngpreneur to designate a certain type of expertise. What these  names are striving to achieve is specificity and recognition. Why? Because you want a name or a brand that your audience can relate to, both as a brand image and as a brand experience. Whenever possible, that name should convey a sense of uniqueness for your expertise, concept or product. It should provide a positive perceived value that is worth the customers’ attention, time and eventually, money. That is what Entrewebneur is all about.<br><br></p>

<h3>What is in a name?</h3>

<p>The Internet society has developed a global culture with a specific language: Internet English (IE). One of the features of IE is an exceptionally fast rate of word creation. An example of this is the use of the affix -preneur in compounds such as Womenpreneur, Homepreneur, Mompreneur, Blackpreneur, Youngpreneur and other variations, to designate a certain type of expertise. Now, is this slew of neologisms really necessary? For their creators the answer is a resonant yes. Why? Because what they are striving to achieve are specificity and recognition.<br><br>

In other words, even if they do not know anything about Targeting and Differentiation, that is what they want. These preneurs feel that whatever they are offering to customers, whether it is a certain knowledge, a new concept or a product, it is useful to at least some of them (their target audience). That is the key. To make your offer relevant to your target audience it is mandatory to make it stand out from your competitors’. To do this, you create a name or a brand that your audience can relate to, both as a brand image and as a brand experience. Whenever possible, that name should convey a sense of uniqueness for your expertise, concept or product. You must create a perceived value that is worth the customers’ attention, time, and eventually, money.<br><br></p>

<h3>Why Entrewebneur?</h3>

<p>At AxBuss Technologies Inc. we perceived the word’s value and its potential for development, secured the most promising related domains (.co.uk, .tv, .net, .org, womentrewebneur.com, entrewebneurship.com and others), created a complete digital identity and finally defined Entrewebneur. For us, an Entrewebneur /?`ntr?w?bn?´r/ is a business-person who develops projects, concepts and other products by innovatively using and combining the resources that are available for him/her on the Web as part of online-only business ventures or as value-added services geared to Web users. Entrewebneurship is the next brand of online business endeavors. A case in point is Entrepreneur.com, a leading goods and services provider for start-ups. Part of this empowerment is based on their ownership of the name. The same applies for the Entrewebneur Digital Identity Project (EDIP). It offers you control over:<br><br></p>

<ul>
	<li>Omnidirectional Applications (Web sites and blogs),</li> 
	<li>Mixed Applications (social networks) and</li>
	<li>Unidirectional Applications (email accounts)</li>
</ul>

<p>These allow a company to improve its Branding, SEM and SEO strategies. We are confident that the EDIP will provide owners with tools to Differentiate, Segment and Target a new audience. By increasing the appeal to include another demographic, they can effectively expand their business strategies to develop specialized and more responsive social networks. After all, a successful site begins with a good domain name, right?<br><br></p>
